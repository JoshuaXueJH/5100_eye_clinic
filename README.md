## Project Progress

#1. Code Progress (70%)
#2. Data Preparation (90%)
Note: As we need to train the model, we need a lot of training data, we have collected 20G image data for model training. 
#3. User Instruction (60%)
#4. Model Building & Testing (20%)
Note: At the begining of the project, we underestimated the time to train the Model with 20G data, so that the building & testing is going very slowly now.
#5. Presentation (10%)
