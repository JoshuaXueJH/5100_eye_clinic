# 5100_prod_recommendation system

Product Recommendations is a subclass of information filtering system that provide suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user.

Recommender Systems can be broadly classified into 3 types
1. Collaborative Filtering
2. Content-Based Filtering
3. Hybrid

Our project will demonstrate the Content-Based filtering, which are based on the description of an item and a profile of the userâ€™s preferred choices. 

In plain words, the algorithms try to recommend products that are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past.
