## Project Progress

1. Code Progress (90%)
2. Data Preparation (100%)
Note: 
1.As we need to train the model, we need a lot of training data, we have collected 7G image data for model training. 
2.To avoid overloaded GitHub repository, we kept most of our data recources locally, so that the data folder in GitHub does not represent full data.
3. User Instruction (100%)
4. Model Building & Testing (100%)
5. Presentation (10%)
Note: We plan to design slides to better present our project.
